# Ethereum-Smart-Contract-to-Frontend-Demo

A web3 interface that connects to an Ethereum contract.

Connect to Metamask
Connect to Contract
Get data from Contract

Using Node, Express, Remix, Solidity, Metamask and HTML we can prove the very basic functionality of interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum Sepolia Test Network.

-Our Metamask wallet address is connected and displayed.
-We can deploy to the Sepolia testnet and view on Etherscan.
-We connect to the contract address on our front end.
-We can get the contract data from the blockchain and display it back on our frontend.

This was a tutorial that I found online but I had to modify a lot of the code to get it to work. 
This is the original video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIudhvTYo38

Out of all of the content that I've been learning from. This is the easiest to understand because the contract literally only has a string myCity to access.
I thought this was perfect to demonstrate the basic concepts of connecting to Metamask, the contract and getting the data from the contract.
